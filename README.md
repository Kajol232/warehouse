## Messaging Queue
Messaging queues are used to send or receive a message, For example if you want to send a welcome message to any 
user that just register on your application to their mail, you used the messaging queue to control the message queue 
in order for some message not to be lost in case the email vendor has a maximum number of message that can be sent.

and also used by the test runtime for mocking data during test.
